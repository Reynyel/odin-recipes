            You may have once struggled with dry or greasy breads 
            reeking of burned or raw garlic, but it's time to put that behind you. 
            This is a versatile recipe, as readily made with thin baguettes,
            as it is with rustic sourdoughs and airy Italian loaves.
            Cutting the bread like a Hasselback potato keeps the butter from
            seeping out and allows the garlic to infuse the bread 
            with its flavor without scorching. But, if it's an extra
            cheesy garlic bread you're looking for, slip a little mozzarella into each slit.
