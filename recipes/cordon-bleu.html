            <li>12 slices thin sliced ham</li>
            <li>4 slices of Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>1 piece raw egg</li>
            <li>4 teaspoon butter, <em>softened</em></li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp paprika, <em>optional</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheaat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Combine softened butter and salt then mix well</li>
            <li>
                Place a piece of chicken breast in a flat surface 
                then brush the top with the butter-salt mixture and 
                sprinkle some paprika.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the chicken breast with ham slices followed by the Swiss Cheese
            </li>
            <li>
                Start rolling the chicken breast from one end to the other.
                Make sure that it is tightly rolled. You may use a toothpick to fasten
                the end of the chicken breast to keep it from rolling back.
            </li>
            <li>
                After rolling all the chicken breast, combine the remaining butter-salt
                mixture with egg and whisk until every ingredient is evenly distributed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Brush the outer part of the chicken breasts with the egg-butter-salt 
                mixture then dredge in bread crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the chicken breasts in a greased baking dish then bake for 25
                minutes. If the chicken is not fully cooked by this time, you can loosely
                cover it with aluminum foil and continue baking at lower temperature
                until the chicken is cooked.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and slice into individual servings.</li>
            <li>Serve hot. Share and enjoy!</li>
